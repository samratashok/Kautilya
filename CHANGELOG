- Fixed a bug in "Hashdump and upload to pastebin" payload. The powershell command was being called from the dumpaste.vbs script without bypassing executionpolicy. This means password hashes were being dumped but not pasted to pastebin..
- Removed TYPESPEED from every payload which was being used as good luck mark and was borrowed from SET :)
- Implemented Left + Enter as a method to say yes to UAC prompt, previously it was Alt + Y. Thanks to Paul who commented this on my blog.
